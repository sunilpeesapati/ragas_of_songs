# Ragas of Telugu songs

http://sunilpeesapati.github.io/ragas_of_songs/

## Note:
1. This list is only for the SCALE and not the actual RAGAM. For example, songs in the ragam Abheri are listed under Kharaharapriya. 
2. Film songs occasionally deviate from the raga or scale. So, the list is valid only for some part of the songs.
3. Keys are approximated to either Major or Minor only. Modes are not listed.
4. If some scale does not feel appropriate, it may be due to difference in perception of Tonic (Graha Bedham). Do check the root note to see if tonic is same.
